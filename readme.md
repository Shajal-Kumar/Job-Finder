**Use this script to find the best job openings for you based on your skills! Job Finder is a web scraper that will return job openings based on your skills.** 

This project is made using Python and utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape **timesjobs.com** for job postings based on the search parameters entered by the user.

## Usage
Using the program is simple, you just have to clone the repo and then install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you're done with installing the requirements, run the script and give inputs as per the prompts. The scraper will return job postings based on your inputs.

## Scope of Improvement
I had a bit of an issue while allowing the script to filter the jobs based on multiple unfamiliar skills. I hope to get back to it soon. üòÅ
